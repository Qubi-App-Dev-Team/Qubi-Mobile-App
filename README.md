# Qubi-Mobile-App

Concept for frontend connection to backend
- Start with sending circuit with values
- Get document id of that circuit, and attach to each run with circuit_id
- Send run
- Everything will be there (hopefully)

Structure
- Post Circuit
- Post Run
- Read Circuit (to create)
- Read Run 
- Update Values (may not be needed)
- Delete Run
- Delete Circuit (to create)
