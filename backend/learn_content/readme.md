To run the learn content management dashboard, you need the ```.env``` and ```service_account.json``` files  in ```Qubi-Mobile-App/backend/learn_content``` (same directory as this README).   
Reach out to Aarush to get those files, as they contain sensitive information for the Supabase storage and Firestore database.

Also, you may need to run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the ```backend``` folder.
